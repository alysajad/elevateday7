4. **Checked Source**
   - Verified if extensions were added by Chrome Web Store, third-party software, or installed by default

5. **Evaluated Each Extension**
   - Compared against user needs and potential security/privacy risks

6. **Made Decision**
   - Retained or recommended removal based on above evaluations
